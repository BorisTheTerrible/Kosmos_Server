Todo:
	Add exception handaling for mutex calls to Logger

Exceptions:
	All code that runs before main() should be guarded with try-catch block
	All function calls dealing with multithreading/file io/socket io should be in a try-catch block
	All function calls that return a number for determining error state, should be checked/converted to exceptions if needed

Files:
	Source files should have format= UppercaseStuff
	Folder should have format= lowercase_stuff
	Non-source files should have format= Uppercase_Stuff

Naming:
	All macro defintions must be UPPERCASE_STUFF
	Enum type must be UppercaseStuff, Enum values must be UppercaseStuff
	Struct type must be UppercaseStuff
	Classes type must be UppercaseStuff
	Function must be lowercaseStuff
	Variables must be lowercaseStuff

Class Header vs Source Files:
	Variables and Methods must be declared in the order they are from the header file

Comments:
	/* Single Line comment */
	/*
	  Multiline comment
	*/

File Order:
	Include Guard:
		*If header file obviously...

	Includes Order:
		Library Includes without directory prefixes
		Library Includes with directory prefixes
		Program Includes without directory prefixes
		Program Includes with directory prefixes
		Original Header File
		Macro Defintions
		Conditional Statements:
			<Includes Order>
		
	Struct Definitions:
		*Can be in any order to fit byte boundaries
	
	Variable Definitions:
		public Unintialized Variables
		public Intialized Variables
		private Unintialized Variables
		private Intialized Variables
		etc...
	
	Function Definition/Declaration:
		<Variable Definitions>
		Code
		*Variable can be declared in the middle of code, just follow the Variable Defintions guideline in general
	
	Class Definitions:
		Public:
			<Variable Definitions>
			
			<Function Definition/Declaration>
			
Class Method Definition
	*Should be defined by order in which they are declared in Class Header
